 * interfere with session-based authentication schemes that require cookies.
 *
 * As persistence, implementations of this interface must also provide storage of cookies. Simple
 * implementations may store cookies in memory; sophisticated ones may use the file system or
 * database to hold accepted cookies. The [cookie storage model][rfc_6265_53] specifies policies for
 * updating and expiring cookies.
